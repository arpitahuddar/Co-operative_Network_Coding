# Co-operative_Network_Coding
▪ Instead of retransmission of packets when lost or damaged relaying approach is used.
▪ Developed TinyOS code and worked on crossbow’s IRIS motes.
▪ Implemented an algorithm related to timer-based relay selection.
▪ This probability scheme chooses a relay, based on both its channel condition and energy availability.
▪ Results indicate significant improvement in Packet Reception Ratio.
